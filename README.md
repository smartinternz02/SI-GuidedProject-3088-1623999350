The way you treat your employees is the way they treat your customers According to a recent article, creating an employee recognition culture can increase
employee retention by up to 31%. Employee recognition is the process of showing appreciation for an employeeâ€™s achievements, actions, and contributions.
In big companies (Amazon/Swiggy/Uber ) appreciation is given to the employees based on the customer feedback or satisfaction (chat process/ voice process). 
Analyzing all the feedback of each customer towards an employee work manually is a tedious job. 

The main objective of this guided project is to appreciate the employee work based on analysis of customer feedback. We are designing an application where 
the HR/ user can upload the feedback report of all the employees. The analysis of each employee report is displayed on the Web application in the form of
Bar charts.
